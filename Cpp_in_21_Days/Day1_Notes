Computers understand programs written in machine code, which is made up of 0's and 1's. 
We generally write programs using a high-level language, which contains words and phrases. 
A program written in this high-level language is called a source code. 
Thus, for a computer to understand, the source code needs to be converted to machine code using a compiler or an interpreter.

**A compiler or an interpreter is a program that converts program written in high-level language into machine code understood by the computer.**

* Interpreter - translates and executes a program as it reads it, turning the program instructions, or source code, directly into actions
Used by: PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby
* Compiler - translates source code into an intermediary form. This step is called compiling, and it produces an object file. The compiler 
then invokes a linker, which combines the object file into an executable form.
Used by: C, C++, C#, Scala
